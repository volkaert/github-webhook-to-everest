## Exposing localhost to the internet

For the purposes of this tutorial, we're going to use a local server to receive messages from GitHub. So, first of all, we need to expose our local development environment to the internet. We'll use ngrok to do this. ngrok is available, free of charge, for all major operating systems. For more information, see the ngrok download page.

After installing ngrok, you can expose your localhost by running ./ngrok http 4567 on the command line. 4567 is the port number on which our server will listen for messages. You should see a line that looks something like this:

$ Forwarding    http://7e9ea9dc.ngrok.io -> 127.0.0.1:4567

Make a note of the *.ngrok.io URL. We'll use it to set up our webhook.
